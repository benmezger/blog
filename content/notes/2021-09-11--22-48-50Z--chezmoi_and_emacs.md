I've recently wanted to integrate [Chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io) with Emacs, so I can avoid switching
to the terminal or `eshell` whenever I needed Chezmoi. I've searched for a few
Emacs and Chezmoi integration and I found [this](https://github.com/tuh8888/chezmoi.el). However, I wanted to play a
bit with Elisp, so I decided to write my own.

The code is still a work-in-progress, but I already have the basic functionality
set up.

`chezmoi.el` provides three functions: `apply`, `edit` and `diff` â€“ all three run
asynchronously. All logs and diffs are stored in the `*chezmoi*` buffer.
Further, `chezmoi-mode` is a minor-mode that sets up keybindings for all three
functions.

The following variables are available: `chezmoi-bin`, `chezmoi-apply` and
`chezmoi-edit`.

  "Path to chezmoi's binary.")

(defvar chezmoi-flags "--color false -v --force -i noscripts"
  "Flags to pass to chezmoi in every run.")

(defun chezmoi-apply()
  "Run chezmoi apply without running scripts."
  (interactive)
  (apply 'start-process
         "chezmoi" "*chezmoi*"
         chezmoi-bin "apply" (split-string chezmoi-flags " "))
  (with-current-buffer "*chezmoi*"
    (diff-mode)))

(defun chezmoi-diff()
  "Run chezmoi diff."
  (interactive)
  (message "Running chezmoi diff...")
  (apply 'start-process
         "chezmoi" "*chezmoi*"
         chezmoi-bin "diff" (split-string chezmoi-flags " "))
  (with-current-buffer "*chezmoi*"
    (diff-mode)
    (read-only-mode)))

                       (expand-file-name (concat "~/" n))))))))

            (define-key map (kbd "C-c E") 'chezmoi-edit)
            (define-key map (kbd "C-c D") 'chezmoi-diff)
            map))

(provide 'chezmoi)
