I've been thinking of changing my nick from `seds` to something else. The
annoying part about this nick is that it is taken almost everywhere.

I will still keep using `benmezger` when available, but y'know, I like the idea of
using a nickname online -- it makes it feel like the beginning of the Internet.

Now I have to think of something other than `seds` 💔.
