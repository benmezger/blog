## Why Integral Calculus {#why-integral-calculus}

Figure [1](#org747401f) represents 2 graphs of `y = cos(x)`. Let's say we would
like to calculate the area of {{<katex>}} x\_1 {{</katex>}}. We could calculate
the area by aproximation, for example, Graph B is filled with the area we would
like to calculate, so we could divide this area by equal sections of
\\(\Delta x\_n\\) from `a` to `b` rectangles, then we could calculate the area of
these rectangles by \\(f(x\_i) \* \Delta x\_n\\) where \\(f\\) is the area of each of
the rectangles. We do this for each rectangle then sum them up: \\(\sum\_{i=1}^n f(x\_i) \*
\Delta x\_n\\). This will give us an approximation of our area, we could have a
better approximation by having our \\(\Delta x\_n\\) smaller, but this implies that
our `n` becomes bigger and bigger. The smaller \\(\Delta x\_n\\) gets, the more `n`
approaches infinity.

We could use \\(\liminf\\) of `n` as `n` approaches &infin; or \\(\Delta x\_n\\) as it
gets very small.

```gnuplot
set multiplot layout 1, 2 title "f(x) = -x ** 2 + 4"

set terminal pngcairo enhanced color size 350,262 font "Verdana,10" persist
set linetype 1 lc rgb '#A3001E'
set style fill transparent solid 0.35 noborder

f(x) = -x ** 2 + 4

set title "A"
plot f(x) with lines linestyle 1

set title "B"
set style fill transparent solid 0.50 noborder
plot f(x) fs solid 0.3 lc rgb '#A3001E'

unset multiplot
```

The idea of getting better and better approximations is the what constitutes
Integral Calculus.
