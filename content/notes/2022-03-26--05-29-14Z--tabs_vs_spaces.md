While during my daily housekeeping, I got intrigued by how much of a
the difference would a tab-based repository be in size in comparison to a
space-based version. To check the difference, I've used the Linux kernel for
comparing the size when converting all tabs to spaces and Python's Pytest
library when converting all spaces to tabs.

Using Python and C repositories was ideal, given Linux uses 8 tabs by default
and the Python community generally sticks with 4 spaces.


## Tab vs spaces {#tab-vs-spaces}

The preference of tab vs. spaces in a codebase is a topic for another day.
Today's topic is how many bytes a tab differs from a space? A tab can be
visually seen as a 4 or 8 space character, but is it more significant in size?

We can display the contexts of a text in hex and see how tabs and spaces are
represented.

```shell
echo "s:    t:\t" | hexdump -C
```

```text
00000000  73 3a 20 20 20 20 74 3a  09 0a                    |s:    t:..|
0000000a
```

The hex value `20` is the ASCII value for the space character, and the value
`09` is the ASCI horizontal tab (`HT`). We know that tab characters use less
space than the space characters when used as tab indentation (`"    "` vs.
`\t`). We can also ensure by using `wc` with the `-c` flag for byte count.

```shell
echo " " | wc -c
echo "  " | wc -c
```

```text
2
3
```

```shell
echo "\t" | wc -c
echo "\t\t" | wc -c
```

```text
2
3
```

So technically, using tabs in a codebase is much cheaper in storage.


## Converting the repositories {#converting-the-repositories}

I've used `expand` and `unexpand` from `coreutils` to convert spaces to tabs and
tabs to spaces. To speed things up when running against all files, I use [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)
and pipe it against my script that converts the file's tab to spaces and
vice-versa.

```bash
#!/bin/env bash
# replace-ts

# for tabs -> spaces, run with:
# fd -e c -e h -x bash -c 'replace-ts s {}'
#
# for spaces -> tabs, run with:
# fd -e c -e h -x bash -c 'replace-ts t {}'

set -euo pipefail

# tabs or spaces?
argtype=$1
# filename
argfilename=$2

if [[ -d $argfilename ]]; then
    exit 0
fi

# tabs -> spaces
cksum=$(cksum $argfilename | cut -f1 -d ' ')
# temporary filename is filename.cksum
filename="$(basename $argfilename).$cksum"

if [[ $argtype == "s" ]]; then
    expand -t 4 "$argfilename" > "/tmp/$filename"
    mv "/tmp/$filename" "$2"
else
    unexpand -t 4 "$argfilename" > "/tmp/$filename"
    mv "/tmp/$filename" "$2"
fi
```

To convert all tabs to spaces, I've ran:

```shell
fd ~/workspace/linux -e c -e h -x bash -c "../replace-tabs s {}"
```

Or to convert all spaces to tabs:

```shell
fd ~/workspace/linux -e c -e h -x bash -c "../replace-tabs t {}"
```


## Linux kernel {#linux-kernel}


### Upstream {#upstream}

The current ([52d543b54](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/52d543b5497cf31d6baeb0bcfe5a5474c3238578)) Linux repository has 1.5G in total; let's see how it
increases or decreases with spaces.

```shell
du -sch ~/workspace/linux/       | tail -1 | cut -f1 -d "t"
du -sch ~/workspace/linux/**/*.c | tail -1 | cut -f1 -d "t"
du -sch ~/workspace/linux/**/*.h | tail -1 | cut -f1 -d "t"
du -sch ~/workspace/linux/**/*.S | tail -1 | cut -f1 -d "t"
```

```text
1.5G
627M
485M
12M
```


### With spaces {#with-spaces}

It seams we have an increase of size in the `c`, `h` and `S` files. There was
also have an increase of 1G when running against all files -- that's 1GB extra
in the repository!

```shell
du -sch ~/workspace/linux/ | tail -1 | cut -f1 -d "t"
du -sch ~/workspace/linux/**/*.c | tail -1 | cut -f1 -d "t"
du -sch ~/workspace/linux/**/*.h | tail -1 | cut -f1 -d "t"
du -sch ~/workspace/linux/**/*.S | tail -1 | cut -f1 -d "t"
```

```text
1.6G
699M
496M
14M
```


## Pytest {#pytest}


### Upstream {#upstream}

By default, Pytest uses spaces. The current ([176d2d7b](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/commit/176d2d7b4e21b19fb08afdb3f9db61495eff5647)) Pytest repository has 38M
in size and 3.2M in Python code.

```shell
du -sch ~/workspace/pytest/ | tail -1 | cut -f1 -d "t"
du -sch ~/workspace/pytest/**/*.py | tail -1 | cut -f1 -d "t"
```

```text
38M
3.2M
```


### With tabs {#with-tabs}

And this is how much space it takes with tabs. We got a decrease of 1MB when
converting all spaces to tabs. Not much, but interesting.

```shell
du -sch ~/workspace/pytest/ | tail -1 | cut -f1 -d "t"
du -sch ~/workspace/pytest/**/*.py | tail -1 | cut -f1 -d "t"
```

```text
37M
2.8M
```
