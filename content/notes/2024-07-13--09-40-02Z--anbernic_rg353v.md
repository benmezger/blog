Last year I got myself the [Anbernic RG353V](https://anbernic.com/products/rg353v-rg353vs) handheld console so I could play
Gameboy Advance and PSP games. At the end, I had little time to play and I had
to leave it in the drawer.

This week I found some time to play with it, but I ended up formatting the SD
with all my ROMs by mistake, so I had to download everything again ðŸ« . Given I
had to restart from zero, I decided to install [ArkOS](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki) instead, due to some of the
nifty features it has.

Because of that, there were some changes to the configuration that I made to
either improve performance or simply user experience, and since this will
probably not be the last time, better keep it written somewhere ðŸ™‚.

-   Improving PPSSPP framerate/performance

    When playing lightweight PSP games, I noticed a drop of framerate and glitchy
    sound. For that I made changes to the PPSSPP configuration.

    1.  Go to PPSSPP settings
    2.  Graphics -> Frame skipping -> Set to `1`
    3.  Graphics -> Auto frameskip -> `enabled`
    4.  Graphics -> Show FPS counter -> `enabled`
-   Enabling SSH access

    Default username: `ark` <br />
    Default password: `ark`

    1.  Configuration -> Enable Remote Service -> `enabled`
-   Download all themes
    1.  Configuration -> Tools -> ThemeMaster
    2.  Settings -> Screen Size -> `640x480`
    3.  Install a theme -> Install all themes
    4.  Quit `ThemeMaster`
    5.  Press `start` -> UI Settings -> Theme
-   Enable threaded loading
    1.  Press `start` -> Advanced Settings -> Threaded Loading -> `enabled`
-   Enable auto suspend
    1.  Press `start` -> Advanced Settings -> Auto Suspend Timeout (MINS) -> `5`

I should update this post as more interesting configuration pop up.
