In 1980, Lehman (1980) summarized the Laws of Program Evolution. The first law,
Continuing Change, expressed the universally observed fact that large programs
are never completed. They just continue to evolve until the more cost-effective
updated version replaces the systems. The second law, Increasing Complexity,
could also be viewed as an instance of the second law of thermodynamics. As an
evolving program is continually changed, its complexity, reflecting
deteriorating structure, increases as well, unless the mission is done, or
maintenance is needed. The third law, The Fundamental Law of Program Evolution,
is subject to dynamics that make the programming process, measures system
attributes and collaborative projects, and self-regulating with statistically
proven trends and invariances. The fourth law, Conservation of Organizational
Stability (Invariant Work Rate), and the fifth law, Conservation of familiarity,
both lead to the third law. The fourth law more focuses on the steadiness of
multiloop self-stabilizing systems. A well-established organization is good at
avoiding dramatic change and particularly discontinuities in the increasing
growth of an organization. Especially in the past two decades, the complexity of
the task that the software system performs has grown dramatically, faster than
hardware due to the fast-paced high technology development (Catelani et al.
2011).
