I had to search and replace many files in a git repository, for some reason
`dired-do-find-regexp-and-replace`, but I found using `counsel-git-grep` with
`wgre` much easier. Here is on you do it:

1.  `M-x counsel-git-grep`
    Search for the string
2.  Press `ivy-occur` key on `ivy`'s search prompt result, which is set to `C-c
       C-o` by default. This will open the search results in a new buffer
3.  On your new buffer, run `wgrep-change-to-wgrep-mode` (`C-c C-p`) and do your
    editing.
4.  `C-c C-c` to apply your changes

I still have to figure out why isn't `dired-do-find-regexp-and-replace` working
properly on strings without any regular expression, for example
`name_to_change`. It might be a bug on my end or upstream, but [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/5y1c11/direddofindregexpandreplace%5Fvs%5Fqueryreplaceregexp/?utm%5Fsource=share&utm%5Fmedium=web2x&context=3) might seem a
bit related.
