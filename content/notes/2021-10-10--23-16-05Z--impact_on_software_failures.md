Software failures can also cause serious consequences in an automobile. Toyota
had to recall almost 2 million Prius hybrid vehicles, in order to fix a software
glitch along with its engine control units (ECUs) in February 2014 (COMPUT-
ERWORLD 2020). A malfunction within the car’s hybrid drive system caused by a
software glitch could, in certain circumstances, cut the system’s power and
cause the car to an unscheduled halt. A software glitch affecting the ECUs
controlling the motor/generator and the hybrid system could put extra thermal
stress on certain transistors under certain conditions. The same software issue
recurred in July 2015, which has resulted in the recall of 625,000 Prius cars
globally. Software failures have affected the healthcare system as well.
Emergency services were unavailable for around six hours across seven U.S.
states in April 2014 (COMPUTERWORLD 2020). The incident had a major impact on 81
call centers, meaning about 6,000 people who made 911 calls that were not able
to connect in these seven states. There is a study announced by the Federal
Communications Commission found that the cause of service unavailable was an
entirely preventable software error.

The nonperformance and failures of software are expensive. A study carried by
the National Institute of Standards & Technology in 2002 found that inadequate
infrastructures for fixing software bugs cost the U.S economy $59.5 billion
every year. What about the global cost of fixing software bugs every year? This
study also estimated that more than a third of software bugs could be eliminated
by improving software testing scheduling and methodology (Tassey 2002).
