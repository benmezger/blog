> In an asynchronous bus, each bus cycle is sequenced by request and
> acknowledgment signals. To perform a bus cycle, the transmitter drives the data
> onto the bus and then asserts the request signal Req. Upon seeing the request
> signal, the receiver samples the data off the bus and asserts an acknowledge
> signal Ack to indicate that the data transfer is complete. Upon receiving the
> acknowledge signal, the transmitter turns its driver off, freeing the bus for
> the next transfer <principelsAndPracticesOfInterconnectionNetworks>.
