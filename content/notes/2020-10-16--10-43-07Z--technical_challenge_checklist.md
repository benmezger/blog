Having done quiet a lot of technical challenges, and having forgotten some
details when submitting, I came up with a good checklist of things to check
before submitting the technical test.


## Must do checklist {#must-do-checklist}

-   [ ] Keep commit readable, check if the company has any commit format of their
    own in their public GitHub organization or their wiki page (if any),
    otherwise, use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
-   [ ] Structure your commits so we can revert in case of any bug. Make your
    `git` history ready for production, see [Personal git workflow]({{<relref "2020-08-04--14-06-04Z--personal_git_workflow.md#" >}})
-   [ ] Use well stable, known libraries
-   [ ] Document your decisions of _why_, _where_ and _how_
-   [ ] Write tests for **everything your write**
-   [ ] Run static code analysers and make sure there aren't any undefined
    variables
-   [ ] Benchmark what you wrote for validating algorithms/project
-   [ ] Configure and use a linter


## Technical project {#technical-project}

-   [ ] Use environment variables for secrets, api urls, debugging and general
    configuration
-   [ ] Enable application logging where needed
-   [ ] Document reusable API functions
-   [ ] Lock dependency versions
-   [ ] Take some time to think of the project structure, create diagrams, check
    out related project's structure
-   [ ] Read and re-read the requirements, if you have any doubts, `do` ask the
    developers/human resources
-   [ ] HTTP API? Run a stress test against your API
-   [ ] Containerize your application
-   [ ] Last but not least, have fun learning


## Algorithms {#algorithms}

-   [ ] Document algorithm decisions and steps
-   [ ] Make algorithm comparison if possible
-   [ ] Don't over complicate. It's not because it's an algorithm that it requires
    to be unreadable
-   [ ] Make sure the algorithm you are applying is well suited for the task
-   [ ] Don't panic, you are not supposed to know all algorithms out there, but
    you are supposed to know where to search and implement your findings


## Bonus {#bonus}

-   [ ] Add CI integration (CircleCI, Travis, GitHub Workflow, etc)
