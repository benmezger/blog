For understanding how pointers work, consider the following simplified memory
layout. the memory address starts in `0x1` and goes up to address `0xA`. The
value row holds the current data stored in that memory cell. Address `0x1` holds
a _pointer_ to address `0x6`, which in turn `0x6` holds the value `s`.

<a id="table--table-memory-layout-simplified"></a>

| Address       | 0x1        | 0x2 | 0x3 | 0x4 | 0x5 | 0x6        | 0x7            | 0x8            | 0x9            | 0xA           |
|---------------|------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| Value         | `0x6`      |     |     |     |     | _s_        | _e_            | _d_            | _s_            | _\\0_         |
| Variable name | `hostname` |     |     |     |     | `hostname` | `hostname + 1` | `hostname + 2` | `hostname + 3` | `hostname +4` |

.. which we can translate to:

```C
int main() {
  char *hostname = "seds"; /* hostname points to 0x6 */
  printf("&hostname is '%p', *hostname is '%c' and hostname is '%s'\n",
         &hostname, *hostname, hostname);

  printf("hostname address is '%p' and hostname[0] address is %p\n\n", hostname,
         &hostname[0]);
  printf("hostname + 1 address is '%p' and hostname[1] address is %p\n",
         hostname + 1, &hostname[1]);

  printf("hostname + 2 address is '%p' and hostname[2] address is %p\n",
         hostname + 2, &hostname[2]);

  printf("hostname + 3 address is '%p' and hostname[3] address is %p\n",
         hostname + 3, &hostname[3]);

  printf("hostname + 4 address is '%p' and hostname[3] address is %p\n",
         hostname + 4, &hostname[4]);
}
```

```text
&hostname is '0x16b666398', *hostname is 's' and hostname is 'seds'
hostname address is '0x10479be3c' and hostname[0] address is 0x10479be3c

hostname + 1 address is '0x10479be3d' and hostname[1] address is 0x10479be3d
hostname + 2 address is '0x10479be3e' and hostname[2] address is 0x10479be3e
hostname + 3 address is '0x10479be3f' and hostname[3] address is 0x10479be3f
hostname + 4 address is '0x10479be40' and hostname[3] address is 0x10479be40
```

```C
int main() {
  char *hostname = "seds"; /* hostname points to 0x6 */

  printf("Hostname is '%s'\n", hostname);
  printf("Hostname first char '%c'\n", *hostname);
  printf("Hostname second char '%c'\n", *(hostname + 1));
  printf("Hostname third char '%c'\n", *(hostname + 2));
  printf("Hostname fourth char '%c'\n", *(hostname + 3));
  printf("Hostname last char '%d'\n", *(hostname + 4));
  printf("Out of bound (garbage) '%c'\n", *(hostname + 5));
}
```

```text
Hostname is 'seds'
Hostname first char 's'
Hostname second char 'e'
Hostname third char 'd'
Hostname fourth char 's'
Hostname last char '0'
Out of bound (garbage) 'H'
```

```C
int main() {
  char *hostname = "seds"; /* hostname points to 0x6 */

  while (*hostname) {
    printf("hostname is '%c', at address %p \n", *hostname, hostname);
    hostname++;
  }
  printf("Hostname is out of bound: '%s', at address %p\n", hostname, hostname);
}
```

```text
hostname is 's', at address 0x104b87f50
hostname is 'e', at address 0x104b87f51
hostname is 'd', at address 0x104b87f52
hostname is 's', at address 0x104b87f53
Hostname is out of bound: '', at address 0x104b87f54
```
