I've recently decided to migrate back to Linux after some years of using a
MacBook. I haven't distanced myself from Linux while using the Mac, as I
had a Thinkpad x320 by my side all the time running Archlinux.

I wanted something much more powerful than the Macbook, along with a lightweight
design and something that would last for the next five years.

I've got myself a Dell XPS, with the following specification:

It's a powerful machine, but that's not what I am here to talk about. I
want to talk about quirks and hacks I needed to do to get the hardware
fully working.

During this writing, I am running Archlinux on a `5.16.5` kernel.


## Wi-Fi {#wi-fi}

Works out of the box with Archlinux


## GPU {#gpu}


### Intel i915 {#intel-i915}

The Intel i915 with NVidia disabled worked out of the box with one issue.

-   Suddenly, Alacritty's window turns black, as if it's completely unresponsive.
    I've tried running with `vblank_mode` set but no luck.

**Update <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2023-06-06 Tue&gt;</span></span>**: <br />
I noticed a few `i915 0000:00:02.0: [drm] *ERROR* Unexpected DE Misc interrupt`
popping up from time to time in `dmesg`, so I made a few configurations, which
seemed to have fixed the error (and the frozen issue!).

In `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`, add `i925` to `MODULES`.

```nil
MODULES=(... i925)
```

Then run `mkinitcpio -p <whatever-kernel-you-have>`.

Create or edit `/etc/X11/xorg.conf`, with the following device. I [think](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/intel%5Fgraphics#Xorg%5Fconfiguration) you can
also create a `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf` and add it there instead, but
I didn't do that.

```nil
Section "Device"
  Identifier "Intel Graphics"
  Driver "intel"
EndSection
```

Reboot.


### Modesetting {#modesetting}

The Modesetting driver works completely out of the box, with no quirks (at least
none found yet).


### NVidia GeForce RTX 3050 Ti Mobile {#nvidia-geforce-rtx-3050-ti-mobile}

Works out of the box with the `nvidia` driver from Archlinux's official
repository. I have tried `bumblebee` out, but no luck getting the hybrid (Intel
and NVidia) to work along.

**Update <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2023-06-06 Tue&gt;</span></span>**: <br />
I tried Linux Mint for a few days and the hybrid mode (intel or nvidia) worked
out of the box.


## Bluetooth {#bluetooth}

Worked out of the box. I had to install `blueman` though, but nothing that you cannot find in the Archlinux wiki.


## Display {#display}

I've disabled the touch functionality of the screen, but it does work out of the
box with Xorg (haven't tested in Wayland).

Brightness works well with `xbacklight` when using the Intel driver or
`light` when using Modesetting.


## USB-C ports {#usb-c-ports}

All are working out of the box.


## Keyboard {#keyboard}

Working out of the box.


## Touchpad {#touchpad}

Works well with `synaptics`, but much better with `libinput`. You can get
`libinput-gestures` to set up asmooth gesture functionality.

**Update <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2023-06-05 Mon&gt;</span></span>**: <br />
Turns out that from time-to-time the touchpad started lagging. This is a known
[issue](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dell%5FXPS%5F15%5F(9510)#Touchpad%5Flag) and I've fixed it by following [this](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libinput/-/issues/618#note%5F1379374) guide to downgrade the touchpad
firmware to `0x000c`.

I am keeping the firmware here as a back up.

_sha256: 11704b552a1e4cf45ab8d48db6da00e50df418d8cdffd261fdd710709ca13e91_


## Fingerprint {#fingerprint}

I haven't tried to get it working yet, but I don't think it will work from what I've seen on the Internet.


## Hibernate/suspend {#hibernate-suspend}

~~I haven't managed to get it working. It seems it needs some configuration in the~~
~~BIOS, but regardless, it did not work.~~

**Update <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-06-17 Fri&gt;</span></span>**: <br />
Turns out I needed to enable the `resume` hook in my `initramfs`, append a
line to my grub configuration and systemd's sleep configuration [[gist](https://gist.github.com/benmezger/fd5a424bb4a2a8649107989dd62dbea0)].

I will keep this updated as time goes by.
