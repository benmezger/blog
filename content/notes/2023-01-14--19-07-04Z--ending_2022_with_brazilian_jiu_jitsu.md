... And starting 2023 with Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) as well. A few months
before the global COVID-19 pandemic, I started swimming again. Still, then the
lockdown began, and I had to cancel my swimming subscription. I never did any
exercise since then.

When I moved back to The Netherlands, I promised myself I would start a new
sport and maintain it weekly. I chose BJJ. The first reason I decided on BJJ was
to keep up with a Brazilian sport, giving me the feeling of having Brazil
nearby. The second reason is to exercise, improve my confidence, decrease
anxiety and learn a martial art.

Until now, I have been enjoying my experience in BJJ and recovering every day
from a new bruise.
