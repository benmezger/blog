## Exceptions {#exceptions}

Exception are unusual condition occurring at run time associated with an
instruction in the current RISCV thread. Exceptions may be converted to traps,
but that all depends on the execution environment.


## Traps {#traps}

Trap refers to the synchronous transfer control to a trap handler caused by an
exceptional condition occurring within a RISC thread. Trap handlers normally
execute in a more privilege environment.


## Interrupts {#interrupts}

Interrupt refers to an external event that occurs asynchronously to the current
RISCV thread. When an interrupt occurs, some instruction gets selected to
receive an interrupt exception and subsequently experiences a trap.


## The Machine trap vector base-address register (`mtvec`) {#the-machine-trap-vector-base-address-register--mtvec}

When something happens in RISCV, the CPU calls the function stored in `mtvec`.
`mtvec` is a XLEN (32-64bit wide) read/write register that holds a **trap vector
configuration** which consists of the base address (the function address) and the
vector mode.

RISCV requires `mtvec` to be always implemented, but can contain a hardwired to
a read-only value. The base field must always be aligned on a 4-byte boundary
however, mode settings may impose additional base field alignment constraints.

We can visualize this as an array for XLEN bits:

```C
/* xlen is 32-bits ie. (int32_t) or 64-bits ie. (int64_t) */
xlen mtvec[xlen];
xlen base = mtvec[xlen-2];
xlen mode = mtvec[2];
```

If mode gets set to `DIRECT MODE`, it means all traps will go to the exact same
function, if `VECTOR mode` is set, all synchronous exceptions into machine mode
cause the `PC` to be set to the address of the base field, whereas interrupts
will set `PC` to `base + 4 * cause`. For example Table [1](#table--tbl:exception-codes) has
machine-mode timer interrupt code `7` causes the PC to be set to BASE + 0x1c
(BASE + 4 \* 7).
