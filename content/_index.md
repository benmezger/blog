`Hello world`,

I am Benjamin Mezger (or Ben), a software engineer based in Amsterdam with a
Master&rsquo;s degree in Computer Science. I design software systems that meet
business requirements and are robust and maintainable in the long term.

My technical interests span across resilient system design, microservice
architecture, distributed systems, observability, system tooling, programming
languages and UNIX.

I&rsquo;ve lived in different countries with different material conditions and
cultures, which has broadened my perspective and helped me adapt quickly to
different environments.

Occasionally, I write technical and non-technical notes at [/notes](/notes). There, I
share some of my thoughts about the real world as I see.

This blog is fully written in Emacs Org Mode, and I [export](https://github.com/benmezger/dotfiles/blob/main/chezmoi/dot%5Fdoom.d/bin/executable%5Forg2blog) them to [Hugo](https://github.com/benmezger/blog).
