_Howdy_!

I am Benjamin Mezger, but everyone started calling me Ben at some point in life.
I am one of the countless software engineers lost in a world of code and
numbers. I have a Master&rsquo;s degree in Applied Computing, emphasizing Fault
Tolerant mitigation in space systems. I&rsquo;m interested in Operating Systems,
Microservices, and Web Scrapping.

Talking about life and code, check my [/notes](/notes) section for some of my writings,
where I sometimes share some of my thoughts. I write all these notes using Emacs
Org Mode, and I [export](https://github.com/benmezger/dotfiles/blob/main/chezmoi/dot%5Fdoom.d/bin/executable%5Forg2blog) them to [Hugo](https://github.com/benmezger/blog).
