`Hello world`,

I am Benjamin Mezger, but at some point everyone started calling me Ben, so
stick with what you prefer. I am one of the countless software engineers lost in
a world of code and numbers. I enjoy designing software systems that meet
business requirements and can be easily extended and maintained.

I live in Amsterdam and I have a Master&rsquo;s degree in Applied Computing,
emphasizing Fault Tolerant mitigation in space systems. My technical interests
span across resilient system design, microservice architecture, distributed
systems, observability, system tooling, programming languages and UNIX.

I&rsquo;ve lived in different countries with different material conditions and
cultures, which has broadened my perspective and helped me adapt quickly to
different environments.

Occasionally, I write technical and non-technical notes at [/notes](/notes). There, I
share some of my thoughts about the real world as I see.

This blog is fully written in Emacs Org Mode, and I [export](https://github.com/benmezger/dotfiles/blob/main/chezmoi/dot%5Fdoom.d/bin/executable%5Forg2blog) them to [Hugo](https://github.com/benmezger/blog).
