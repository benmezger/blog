## Hi, there {#hi-there}

My name is Benjamin Mezger[^fn:1] and I am one of many software engineers lost in
a world of code and numbers. In day [job](https://ckl.io), I work on a large Python E-commerce
code-base with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/) on a team of 7 software engineers.

I&rsquo;m interested in computer security, operating systems, and computer
architecture. I enjoy this field so much, I developed a Microkernel for the
RISC-V ISA for my Bachelor thesis.

I worked for 4 years as a researcher at the laboratory of Distributed Systems at
the university of Univali. I jumped across different fields while working as a
researcher, but I mostly worked on IoT solutions, system programming, and web
applications.

I tend to get thoughtful when asked &ldquo;_where are you from_&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s quite a
long story. But here is a _TL;DR_ in some paragraphs:

I was born in Milan, however, as parents did not have Italian citizenship, and
Italy is a _Jus sanguinis_ state, I ended up having my father&rsquo;s citizenship,
German.

Years later after moving around Italy and Germany, we moved to the south of
Brazil, where I lived for 3 years before my parents got divorced and my mother
moved to Amsterdam and me, my sister, stepmother, and father moved to [Sark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sark), in
the Channel Island.

Two years later, we moved to Portugal and then back to England, but this time,
we moved to London.

Years later I moved in with my mother in Amsterdam, where I stayed most of my
teenage years. I later moved to Brazil for studying my Bachelor in Computer
Science.
