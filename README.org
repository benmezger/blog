This is my personal blog.

* Requirements
- Hugo >= =v0.74.3=
- Git
- Orgmode (non-required)

* Running
1. Run =git submodule update --init= to clone the theme.
2. Run =hugo serve= and go to =http://localhost:1313=

* Writing posts
I use orgmode to write my posts and export it to Hugo's Markdown format

** Org to Hugo
Run the following to generate all roam files to Hugo.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
bash export.sh
#+END_SRC

* Deploying
** Github.io
Run =hugo --config gh_config.yaml=, this will generate a =public/= with the
generated HTML content. Move this to your github.io repository and push.
** Netlify
Connect Netlify to your Github repository and push this repository.

* Overwriting templates
Overwrite your template in [[file:layouts/][layouts]] directory, which is organized per section and taxonomy.
